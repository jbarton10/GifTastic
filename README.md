GIFtastic is an app that was my first time working with API's.  In this I learened the basic structure for quering websites and how to
deal with JSON objects that you get as responses.  The purpose of this app is to get 10 gifs back from giphy of one certain category
depending on what the user inputed into the search bar, while also keeping a history of those queries.
